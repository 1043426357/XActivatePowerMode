An Xcode plug-in makes [activate-power-mode](https://github.com/JoelBesada/activate-power-mode) happen in your Xcode.

**NOTE THAT THIS VERSION IS VERY BUGGY RIGHT NOW**

## How to install and use?

The best way of installing is by [Alcatraz](http://alcatraz.io). Install Alcatraz followed by the instruction (search `XActivatePowerMode`), restart your Xcode and it works by default.

If you do not like the Alcatraz way, you can also clone the repo. Then build the `XActivatePowerMode` target in the Xcode project and the plug-in will automatically be installed in `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins`. Relaunch Xcode and it will work too.

## Deactivate Tips

The switch is under the menu <kbd>Edit</kbd> -> <kbd>Activate Power Mode</kbd>, just click that or **uninstall this plug-in**.

## Make your own particle effect?

The default effect was builded with [UIEffectDesigner](http://www.touch-code-magazine.com/uieffectdesigner/), make your own by replacing the `default.ped`
